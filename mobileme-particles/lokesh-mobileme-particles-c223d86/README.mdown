# MobileMe-like Particles

This is a javascript particle system, that utilize images and canvas, in an attempt to recreate the magical, wispy particles found on the [MobileMe login page](https://auth.me.com/authenticate?service=mail). 

A lot of the core particle system code was written by [Seb Lee-Delisle](http://sebleedelisle.com).
